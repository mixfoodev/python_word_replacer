# README

This is a simple Python script that can rename multiple filenames and replace multiple words in files.

**How it works**

- Set the parent directory of the files you want to rename
- Provide a file that contains the words to be replaced in key/value pairs. Eg. word:replacement

A sample is provided in order to help you better understand how it works.
