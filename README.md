This is a simple Python script that can rename multiple filenames and replace multiple words in files.

**How it works**

- Edit config.py and customize the settings to your needs.
- Set the parent directory of the files you want to rename.
- Provide a file that contains the words to be replaced as key/value pairs. Eg. word:replacement.\
  _**NOTE:** the words are case sensitive._

The script will inform you for any filename or word that will rename, and will ask you if you want to procceed or not.

A sample is provided in order to help you better understand how it works.
